My little boy is 16, where have the years gone?
My little boy who never slept.
2am and I was driving him around trying to get him to sleep
Night time wanderings - i had to put a lock on his bedroom door so he stayed in his room all night and didn&#039;t go downstairs and turn on TV at 3am
Highly intelligent - worked out how to unlock the safety lock on his car chair while i was driving on the M25 !!!
The crazy little boy who dressed up as Micky Mouse to attract more people to donate money for on off my races.
Always intetested in graphics design.... I remember driving down Swanley by pass Mark went balistic in the back seat trying to say his first word - i thought he was trying to say MUMMY - how cute... But how wrong................</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, 21 July 2013 at 07:13 UTC+01</div><div class="comment">Happy Happy birthday bro! Hope your day is as awesome as you are!

An hour later, Another suicide bomber, detonated his bomb aboard the number 30 bus in Tavistock Square, killing himself and 13 others. 
Besides the 52 who died in total, hundreds were injured. Despite the country&#039;s biggest anti-terror operation, a number of arrests and two trials, no one has ever been convicted. 
May the victims of this terrorist crime rest in Peace.. And the Extremists burn in Hell.
7 years to this day... Forever gone&#039; never forgotten.
Now i bet 99% won&#039;t forward on this status, but please do - and show your respects.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, 5 July 2012 at 21:42 UTC+01</div><div class="comment">L:8

If you&#039;re gay, it&#039;s a sin. If you&#039;re skinny you&#039;re on drugs. If you&#039;re fat, you look obese. If you&#039;re dressed up, you&#039;re conceited. If you dress for comfort you&#039;re a slob. If you speak you&#039;re mind, you&#039;re arrogant. If you don&#039;t say anything, you&#039;re ignorant. If you are sweet to strangers, you are fake. If you cry, you&#039;re a drama queen. If you have male friends, you&#039;re a whore. If you have female friends, you&#039;re a player. You can&#039;t do anything without being labeled. We live in a society where people can&#039;t survive if they&#039;re not judging the next person. If you&#039;re proud of who you are &amp; don&#039;t give two shits about what anybody has to say, copy and paste! ♥ Be you.
